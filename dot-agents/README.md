# dot-agents

Single source of truth for Bryan's **personal agent skills**, shared across the
four coding agents he runs: **Claude Code**, **Pi**, **OpenCode**, and **Hermes**.

## How it works

`skills/` is a flat pool — one directory per skill, one canonical copy. Each tool
gets a *curated subset* via per-skill symlinks created by
[`../setup-platform-configs.sh`](../setup-platform-configs.sh):

```
~/.claude/skills/<name>          -> dot-agents/skills/<name>
~/.config/opencode/skills/<name> -> dot-agents/skills/<name>
~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>        -> dot-agents/skills/<name>
~/.hermes/skills/personal/<name> -> dot-agents/skills/<name>
```

The setup script is idempotent: it links the curated skills, prunes symlinks that
are no longer curated, and **never touches** anything that isn't a symlink into
this pool — so Claude's plugin skills (`gsd-*`, `superpowers`, etc.) are left alone.

Why a flat pool instead of per-tool subfolders: most skills are wanted by 2+ tools.
Subfolders would force either duplicate copies or a `common/` + cross-folder symlink
layer. A flat pool keeps one copy of each skill and makes "give tool X skill Y" a
one-line change to an array below.

## Curation

Not every tool gets every skill. Pi is kept lean. Hermes gets adapted personal
workflows but keeps its bundled/local `obsidian` and `vault-pkm` implementations,
so those names are intentionally excluded from its pool links. The authoritative
lists are the `*_SKILLS` arrays in `setup-platform-configs.sh`; this table mirrors
them.

## Adding or re-curating a skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (plus optional `references/`, `templates/`).
2. Add `<name>` to the relevant `*_SKILLS` array(s) in `setup-platform-configs.sh`
   — or to `COMMON_SKILLS` to give it to all three tools.
3. Run `./setup-platform-configs.sh` to (re)build the symlinks.

To pull a skill from a tool, drop it from that tool's array and re-run — the prune
step removes the now-stale symlink.

## Notes

- Hermes's `personal/` entries are ordinary symlinks into this repository. A
  foreground skill edit can therefore modify the canonical pool; review diffs
  before committing. Hermes's autonomous curator does not own these files.
- Some skills carry **local-only, gitignored** content (e.g. `voice-bryan`'s
  verbatim corpus under `references/`). It lives in the pool dir on each machine but
  is never committed; a fresh clone starts without it.
- This pool replaced two former per-tool copies (`dot-claude/skills/`,
  `dot-config/opencode/skills/`) that drifted out of sync.
